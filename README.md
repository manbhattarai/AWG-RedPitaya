# AWG-RedPitaya
An arbitrary waveform generator is implemented in the FPGA of Red Pitaya. A text files with the set of points defining the waveform can be loaded into the programming logic (PL) directly via the processing subsystem (PS) of the FPGA. The DAC can output the waveform at a maximum rate of 125 MSps.
